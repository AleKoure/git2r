The personal access token is stored in an envrionmental variable.
Environmental variables can be written to the file
\code{.Renviron}. This file is read by \emph{R} during startup,
see \code{\link[base]{Startup}}. On GitHub, personal access tokens
function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used
instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, see
\url{https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/}
}
