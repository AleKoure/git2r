# Introduction to git2r

The package gives you programmatic access to Git repositories from
R. The goal of this document is to introduce you to the methods that
git2r provides and show you how to apply them to Git repositories.

Internally the package uses the libgit2 library which is a pure C
implementation of the Git core methods. It's designed to be fast and
portable. For more information about libgit2, check out libgit2's
website [(http://libgit2.github.com)](http://libgit2.github.com).
