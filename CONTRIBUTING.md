# Welcome to git2r!

Contributions to the `git2r` project are welcome and appreciated. Here
follow some guidelines and description of the project to make it
easier for you to submit pull requests, report issues, and provide
feedback.

## Licensing

By contributing to git2r, you agree to release your contribution under
the terms of the [GPL v2 license](LICENSE).

## Sign your work

To improve tracking of who did what, we've borrowed the "sign-off"
procedure from the Linux kernel project -
[A Developerâ€™s Certificate of Origin](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin).
Although `git2r` is a lot smaller project it is a good discipline to
follow it.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for
the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have
the right to pass it on as a open-source patch. The rules are
pretty simple: if you can certify the below:

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

This line can be automatically added by Git if you
[configure](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)
your `user.name` and `user.email` and run the git commit command with
the
[-s](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html)
option:

```
git commit -s.
```

## Overall design `git2r <- libgit2 + R`

Internally the git2r package use the
[libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/) C library to interface a Git
repository. C code can be called from R using the `.Call`
method. However, in order to map the R data structures to C data
structures used by libgit2 an intermediate layer of C code is between
the R methods and libgit2, see figure below.

![Overall design](figure/git2r-design.png)

### R code

The package is based on S4 classes/methods. Each S4 class is prefixed
with `git_` to have the same name as the corresponding libgit2 data
structure. The naming strategy for methods is to use the data
structure (branch, note, stash) followed by the action (create, list,
remove) e.g. note_create, note_list and note_remove etc. However, the
naming is not completely consistent in the package, e.g. `init`
instead of `repository_init`.


#### Documentation

The package documentation is written with
[roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html)
version 4.0.1.  All contributed methods and classes must be
documented. Moreover, all exported methods should have examples of
their usage. Please file an issue if you spot a method in the
documentation without an example, or better a pull request. The
recommended way to generate man files from the roxygen documentation
is to run the `roxygen` target in the `Makefile`

```
make roxygen
```

### Tests

The tests for the package can be found in the `tests` folder. All
contributions of code should have corresponding tests.

### C code

The `git2r` C code is in files prefixed with `git2r_` in the `src`
folder. The `libgit2` C code is located in `src/libgit2` with
dependencies in `src/http-parser` and `src/regex`.

#### Naming

The git2r C functions are named with the prefix `git2r_module` where
`module` group related functionality e.g. `git2r_repository_open` and
`git2r_repository_init`. The source code for each module is in
`git2r_module.c` and `git2r_module.h`.

#### Code layout

1. **Argument checking:** All R arguments must be checked prior to
   their usage. There exists several help functions in
   `src/git2r_arg.h` to facilitate argument checking. The `repo`
   argument is checked in the `git2r_repository_open` function and
   returns `NULL` on failure.

2. **Perform the actual work:** The error code (return value) from
   each call to a libit2 function must be checked. In case of an error
   initiate cleanup.

3. **Cleanup:** All allocated resources must be freed. In case of an
   error, call `Rf_error` with the error message.

#### Documentation

Document functions and parameters with Doxygen to enable generation of
documentatation of the internal git2r C code.

### Code style

It's very important to have a consistent code style, so before
submitting, make sure the code is matching surrounding code.

### Makefile

To facilitate development a [Makefile](Makefile) exists in the root
folder with targets for several common tasks. For an introduction to
make, see e.g. the
[minimal make](http://kbroman.github.io/minimal_make/) tutorial by
Karl Broman.

* **roxygen** Rebuild R documentation with
  [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html). Checks
  that the correct version of *roxygen2* is installed.

* **check** Build package and then run `R CMD check` to
  [test](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Checking-packages)
  the package.

* **check_valgrind** Build package and then run `R CMD check` with
  [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) to detect possible problems.

* **valgrind** Run all test code with valgrind.

* **sync_libgit2** Sync git2r with changes in the libgit2 C-library

  1. Clone or pull libgit2 to parent directory from
     https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git

  2. Run `make sync_libgit2`. It first removes files and then copy
     files from libgit2 directory. Next it runs an R script to build
     Makevars.in and Makevars.win based on source files. To
     [pass](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-portable-packages)
     `R CMD check git2r` the printf calls must be changed to use the R
     [printing](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Printing)
     routine `Rprintf`. Therefore it runs a `patch` command to change
     some lines in the source code to pass `R CMD check git2r`.

  3. Build and check updated package `make check`

* **Makevars** The code in src is compiled with a
  [Makevars](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Using-Makevars)
  file ([Makevars.in](src/Makevars.in) and
  [Makevars.win](src/Makevars.win)). They are automatically generated
  from an R [script](tools/build_Makevars.r) when running this target.

* **configure** Generate a `configure` script from `configure.ac` with
  [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/). The
  [configure](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup)
  script is used on non-Windows platforms to generate a
  system-dependent configuration and detect e.g. `OpenSSL` and
  `LibSSH2` before installation.

* **clean** Remove temporary and object files.
